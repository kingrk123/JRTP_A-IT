In last few days we discussed about below concepts
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Apache kafka
-----------------
-> It is a distributed streaming platform which is used to exchange messages from one application to another application. It is mainley used to process stream of data.

2) Redis Cache
---------------
-> When we want to use static data in one application then we will go for cache implementation.

-> If we want to use same static data in multiple applications/apis then we will go for distributed cache.

-> Redis Cache we can use to implement distributed cache. It is an open source software.

3) Spring Security
------------------
-> Spring Security is used to secure our applications.
-> By using Spring Security we will implement Authentication and Authorization.
-> In Memory Authentication
-> JDBC Authentication
-> UserDetailsService Authentication

4) JWT
----------
-> JWT stands for JSON Web Token

-> JWT is used to implement token based security

5) Config Server
----------------
-> Config Server is used to seperate application and application properties.

-> To externalize config props we will use this Config Server concept.

6) Docker
----------
-> It is used to simplify application deployment process in multiple environments.

-> Docker is a containerization platform.
